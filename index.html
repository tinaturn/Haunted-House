        <div>The family of 5 that once lived here</div>  
        
        <div>In 1967, a family of 5 lived here in this house until an evil spirit was unleashed.  
            The eldest of the 3 children, a boy named Chucky found something he dugged up from the back yard.
            It was evil, because it possessed him and Chucky killed his entire family with a huge knife. 
        </div>
        
         <div>The Myers, all murdered by the eldest child, have haunted this house for many years.
            Their souls are bound to this house and will never leave.  Many people have tried to make
            their home here, and left in terror and fright.  Now sits vacant and looks creepy.
